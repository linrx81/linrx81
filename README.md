- ⚡ Fun fact: Once upon a time, I was a scholar with the now defunct Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore. I was a high flyer, before I crashed to the ground after being diagnosed with clinical depression in 2012 followed by bipolar in 2018 and schizoaffective disorder in 2019. Today, I am a grassroots contributor while serving part time to help out my family business. I still suffer from symptoms of mental illness though my condition is kept under control with daily medication.
